# PThread_Credit_Card_Validation

## Problem Description

> This project consists of writing a Synchronous Multithreaded Program that implements Luhn
Algorithm for Credit card number validation.

**Specifics**

        + Create multiple threads, each of which run in parallel creating **Thread-level parallelism**
        + This involves examining the algorithm steps to find areas that can be divided into
            separate, **concurrent** tasks. Tasks (threads) are independent of one another and thus can
            run in parallel on multiple computing cores.
        + The data accessed by the threads must be examined for dependencies between two or
            more threads. When one thread depends on data from another, ensure that the execution
            of the tasks is **synchronized** to accommodate the data dependency
        + In **Synchronous Threading**, parent thread creates multiple children (or worker threads)
            and then must wait for all of its children to terminate before it resumes. The threads
            reated by the parent perform work concurrently, but the parent cannot continue until this
            work has been completed. Once each thread has finished its work, it terminates and joins
            (example: pthread_join(), or Javaâ€™s thrd.join()) with its parent. Only after all of the
            children have joined can the parent resume execution.
        + Synchronous threading involves significant data sharing among threads. The parent
            thread combines the results calculated by its various children and outputs the final results.

**Luhn Algorithm**

The Luhn Algorithm- also known as the Modulus 10 check - is a formula that is used to
determine whether the identification number provided by a user is accurate. The formula is
widely used in validating credit card numbers. The algorithm is used to validate a variety of
identification numbers, such as National Provider ID, Canadian SIN, Israeli ID, South African
ID, Greek SSN, and International Mobile Equipment ID.

**Program Steps:**

Credit Card numbers follow certain patterns. Verify the following requirements:

    1. A credit card number must have between 13 and 19 digits.
    2. Check if it starts with the major industry identifier of the Issuer identification number
        + 3 for American Express cards
        + 6 for Discover cards
        + 5 for Master cards
        + 4 for Visa cards

Card numbers are generated following this validity check which can be described as follows (for
illustration, consider the card number 4388576018402626):
    3. Double every second digit from right to left. If doubling of a digit results in a two-
        digit number, add up the two digits to get a single digit number.

        ![image2](/images/image2.png)

Now add all single-digit numbers from Step 3.
    4+4+8+2+3+1+7+8=37

    4. Add all digits in the odd places from right to left in the card number.
        6 + 6 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 7 + 8 + 3 = 38
    5. Sum the results from Step III and Step IV.
        37+38=75
    6. If the result from Step V is divisible by 10, the card number is valid; otherwise, it is
        invalid.

**TEST DATA:**

The number 4388576018402626 is invalid
The number 4388576018410707 is valid.

**Implementation:**

    1. This program will be passed a series of credit card numbers on the command line. Card
numbers must not be hard-coded in the program. Embedding data directly into the source
code demands recompiling.
    2. Allocate each worker thread a computational task of the algorithm. Parent will create
separate worker threads for program steps 1, II, III, and IV.
    3. Once the worker threads have exited, the parent thread will output the following results:
        a. Display which of the the credit card numbers are valid or and which are invalid.
        b. If valid, display if the card is issued by American Express, Discover, Mastercard,
            or Visa.
